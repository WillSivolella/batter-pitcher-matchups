# MLB Pitching and Hitting Clustering Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of the Major League Baseball (MLB) event data. Our primary goal was to understand and identify patterns in pitching and hitting performances by clustering MLB pitchers and hitters. We utilized a variety of clustering techniques to categorize players and analyzed how these clusters interact, providing insights into which clusters of pitchers perform best against specific clusters of hitters, and vice versa.

## Key Features

- **Data Mining**: Extracted detailed data on every pitch and result from prior MLB season. This data was mined from multiple sources to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy.

- **Clustering Techniques**:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Grouped pitchers and hitters into distinct clusters based on various performance metrics.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Analyzed the hierarchical relationships among clusters to understand deeper patterns in player performance.
  - **Mixture-Model Clustering**: Applied mixture models to account for the possibility of a player belonging to multiple clusters, offering a nuanced view of player performance.

- **Performance Analysis**: Determined which clusters of pitchers were most effective against specific clusters of hitters, providing valuable insights that can be used for strategic decision-making.

## Results

The analysis revealed significant patterns and relationships between different clusters of pitchers and hitters. By understanding these interactions, teams can better strategize player matchups, optimize game plans, and ultimately improve their competitive edge.
